# Bike_Sharing
The objective of this analysis is to analyze the Citibike NYC data throughout August 2019 and put together a business proposal for the Des Moines, Iowa area. The question is: Should Des Moines adopt a city bike program?

## Overview: 
I created an analysis using Tableau to help investors visualize the potential for a bike-sharing program in Des Moines. My bike trip analysis provides the following:
- The length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
- The number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week.
- The number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

I also included a dashboard that contains the basic information necessary to understand these visualizations. 
Those visualizations include:
- Number of trips.
- Customer type.
- August peak hours and a suggestion for bike repair times. 
- Gender breakdown. 
- Top starting ride locations (filtered by popularity)
